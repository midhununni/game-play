Add the ! as a postfix to the variable name as follows

class Person {
  name!: string
}
When you add an exclamation mark after variable/property name, you’re telling to TypeScript that you’re certain that value is not null or undefined.

You can also get rid of warning by setting strictPropertyInitialization: false inside tsconfig.json
